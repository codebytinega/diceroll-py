## üìà Key Business Logic

### Automatic Calculations
- **Profit Per Unit**: `selling_price - buying_price`
- **Profit Percentage**: `((selling_price - buying_price) / buying_price) * 100`
- **Total Sale Cost**: `selling_price * quantity_sold`
- **Sale Profit**: `(selling_price - buying_price) * quantity_sold`
- **Profit Margin**: `(profit / total_cost) * 100`

### Stock Management
- **Low Stock Alert**: Triggered when `quantity <= 5`
- **Stock Deduction**: Automatic after each sale
- **Overselling Prevention**: Validates available stock before sale
- **Inventory Valuation**: `buying_price * quantity`

### Data Integrity
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses Django's atomic transactions
- **Validation**: Form and model-level validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages
- **Data Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints
